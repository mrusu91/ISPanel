An UNIX firewall / router manager written in Java. 

This project is composed of two apps. One is the server app which should run on server,
and the other one is an Android app which gives you the ability to manage the server.

This is just a microscopic chunk of a project started during TechAbility event.


// TODO: A lot :)  couple of ideas:
   - Implement Java wrappers to networking tools like iptables, tc, iproute, dhcpd, etc
   - Define a layer of supported features on top of those tools
   - Implement an API for controlling those features
   - Implement an User Interface on server that use the API
   - Find a secure communication protocol between server and Android app (HTTPS maybe?)
   - Add the ability to manage server features on Android app usng the API layer
